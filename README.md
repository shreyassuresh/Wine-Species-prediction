Vine Species Prediction with Random Forest
Interactive Web Interface: Developed using Streamlit, the tool allows users to interact with the model by inputting features of a biological sample and instantly receiving a prediction of the species.
Real-time Prediction: Leveraging machine learning, the app can predict species in real time based on user inputs (e.g., petal and sepal measurements).
Data Visualization: Integrated with interactive graphs, users can visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier or explore feature relationships in the dataset.
Model Interpretability: Implemented techniques like feature importance (from Random Forest) to show users how the model is making predictions.
